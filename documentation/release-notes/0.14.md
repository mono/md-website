**MonoDevelop 0.14** has been released. MonoDevelop is a GNOME IDE primarily designed for C# and other .NET languages.

This release contains lots of improvements, new features and bug fixes. Read below.

### Installing MonoDevelop

#### MonoDevelop Dependencies

Compiling the following order will yield the most favorable response.

-   Gtk# 2.8.0
-   Gtksourceview\#-2.0 0.10
-   Monodoc 1.0
-   Gecko\#-2.0 0.10
-   MonoDevelop 0.14 Source

You can download MonoDevelop 0.14 source from [here](/download/ "Download"). The Mono download site contains packages for everything for many popular distros. You can also check the mono redcarpet channel.

This release of MonoDevelop needs at least Mono 1.1.10 to run.

### New Features

#### Improved Toolbox and Properties pad

The Toolbox and Properties pads have been improved, and they now are used by the Gtk# designer (so there isn't anymore a separate widget palette).

The new Properties pad can now be used to change properties of project items, such as project files.

(Lluis Sanchez)

#### Subversion add-in

The Subversion add-in will now prompt the user when a password or user name is required. It allows using the add-in to access Subversion repositories which require authentication, such as SourceForge. (Lluis Sanchez)

The add-in now support more recent versions of Subversion, such as the ones distributed by Debian or Ubuntu. (Jeff Stedfast)

#### Refactory operations

Several new refactory operations have been added to the right-click context menu of the source editor. These are:

-   **Rename**: Renames the selected language item in the current source file as well as all other source files referencing it.
-   **Implement Interface**: Injects stub methods, properties and events of the selected interface into the currently selected class.

-   **Encapsulate Field**: Encapsulates the selected class field in a PascalCased property of similar name.

#### New Open Solution File Dialog

The new **Open File in Solution** command provides a quick file search dialog which can be used to locate a project file by name or by class name.

#### Class and member selectors

The text editor has a new class and member selector which allows quick navigation through the file. (James Fitzsimons)

#### Improved Smart Indenting for CSharp

The Smart Indent logic has been completely replaced with a new engine which attempts to keep state as you type and bases indent level on the entire state of the file and not just the indent level of the previous line.

(Jeff Stedfast)

#### Project export/conversion

The new **Export Project** command allows converting a project to another file format, such as Visual Studio 2005. (Lluis Sanchez)

#### New packaging features

This release includes new features for packaging projects. The new **Create Package** command shows a wizard which allows creating three kinds of packages:

-   An archive of sources, which allows choosing the file format (e.g. MonoDevelop or VS2005).
-   An archive of binaries.
-   A tarball (based on Automake).

The new packaging add-in also allows creating a new type of project: a **Packaging Project**. A packaging project can be added to a solution and can define several *packages* to be built for the solution. Each package can be of different kind (archives, tarballs) and can include different project selections.

The packaging add-in takes advantages of the new **deployment model**, which allows specifying the target directory of project files. For example, it is possible to specify that a file needs to be copied to the libs directory, or to the shared directory.

#### Desktop Integration

MonoDevelop now includes options to easily integrate applications in the Linux desktop. It can automatically:

-   generate launch scripts
-   create a .desktop file describing the application. Once installed the application will be shown in the desktop application menu.
-   create .pc files for libraries.

(Lluis Sanchez)

#### Improved New Project Dialog

The *New Project* dialog is now a two-step wizard. The first step of the wizard allows choosing the kind of project to create and its location and name (it is basically the same dialog in previous versions).

The second step is new, and allows selecting a set of features to be enabled in the new project. Some of the features may be already enabled depending on the kind of project. Other features can be enabled by the user.

The features currently supported are:

-   Gtk# support: allows enabling Gtk# designer support on any project.
-   Packaging: allows adding packaging projects to the solution.
-   Unix integration: adds support for .desktop files and launch scripts.

#### Navigation toolbar

A Navigation toolbar has been implemented allowing developers to navigate backwards and forwards in their source file position history, either by using the quick *Navigate Back*/*Navigate Forward* toolbar buttons or by selecting a particular navigation point via the history dropdown menus in the toolbar.

On the other hand, the **Go to declaration** command will now work for types defined in assemblies which contain debug information.

(Jeff Stedfast)

#### New features in the Gtk# designer

There are several improvements in the Gtk# designer:

-   The designer now uses better defaults for widget spacing and other common widget properties. The dialog template now includes ok/cancel buttons.
-   Support for internal windows and custom widgets.
-   Image files assigned to buttons or other widgets are now automatically added to the project, and scheduled for deployment.

(Lluis Sanchez)

#### Other features

-   The **New File** dialog now allows adding the new file to a project. (Jeff Stedfast)
-   Several improvements in **VS2005 support** and makefile integration. (Ankit Jain)
-   Added new options for setting a **custom font** for the treeview pads. (Jeff Stedfast)
-   Added highlighting current line functionality when gtksourceview supports it and drawing of **white spaces and control chars**. (David Makovský)
-   Added option for customizing the **default file header** to be shown when creating new files (Mike Krüger)
-   The Visual Basic add-in is now based on the **vbnc compiler**. (Miguel de Icaza)

<!-- -->

-   Many performance and memory usage improvements. Startup time has been greatly improved.

<!-- -->

-   A new deployment model.

<!-- -->

-   Support for property providers, which allow using the property pad to edit the properties of any element of the IDE.

### Thanks

All of our wonderful testers who put up with the insane dependencies, the constant breakage and still managed to post nice bug reports.

Mike Krueger and the rest of the AlphaSierraPapa team for giving us a great codebase to start from, and continuing improvements.

All of the active MonoDevelop developers.
