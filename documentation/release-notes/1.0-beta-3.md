**MonoDevelop 1.0 Beta 3 (0.18)** has been released. MonoDevelop is a GNOME IDE primarily designed for C# and other .NET languages.

This release contains lots of bug fixes, some new features and improvements. Read below.

### Installing MonoDevelop

Compiling the following order will yield the most favorable response.

-   Gtk# 2.8.0
-   Gtksourceview\#-2.0 0.10
-   Mono.Addins 0.3
-   Monodoc 1.0
-   MonoDevelop 0.18 Source

**It is highly recommended to use Gtk# 2.8.4, since it includes important memory use and performance improvements.**

You can download MonoDevelop 1.0 Beta 3 source from [here](/download/ "Download"). The Mono download site contains packages for everything for many popular distros.

This release of MonoDevelop needs at least Mono 1.1.10 to run.

#### Installing Add-ins

Starting in this release some add-ins are distributed as separate packages. Those packages are:

-   monodevelop-boo: Boo language binding.
-   monodevelop-java: Java language binding (with IKVM).
-   monodevelop-database: database management add-in.

### New Features and Improvements

This release is mainly focused on bug fixing, but there are also some new features and improvements:

#### Improved Dock Manager

MonoDevelop now has an improved dock manager which makes a more efficient use of the available space, and supports auto-hide of panels.
