**MonoDevelop 1.0 Release Candidate 1 (0.19)** has been released. MonoDevelop is a GNOME IDE primarily designed for C# and other .NET languages.

This release contains lots of bug fixes. Read below.

### Installing MonoDevelop

Compiling the following order will yield the most favorable response.

-   Gtk# 2.8.0
-   Gtksourceview\#-2.0 0.10
-   Mono.Addins 0.3
-   Monodoc 1.0
-   MonoDevelop 0.19 Source

**It is highly recommended to use Gtk# 2.8.4, since it includes important memory use and performance improvements.**

You can download MonoDevelop 1.0 RC1 source from [here](/download/). The Mono download site contains packages for everything for many popular distros.

This release of MonoDevelop needs at least Mono 1.1.10 to run.

#### Installing Add-ins

Some add-ins are distributed as separate packages. Those packages are:

-   monodevelop-boo: Boo language binding.
-   monodevelop-java: Java language binding (with IKVM).
-   monodevelop-database: database management add-in.

### Thanks

All of our wonderful testers who put up with the insane dependencies, the constant breakage and still managed to post nice bug reports.

Mike Krueger and the rest of the AlphaSierraPapa team for giving us a great codebase to start from, and continuing improvements.

All of the active MonoDevelop developers.
